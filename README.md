getENRICH - Automated pipeline for enrichment analysis in non-model organisms!

getENRICH is designed to address the unique needs of researchers working with non-model organisms (and model organisms). The tool features a user-friendly command line interface (CLI), ensuring that researchers can easily input data and interpret results. Web application (GUI) is also available at the location www.getenrich/github.com. getENRICH is compatible with a wide range of non-model organisms and integrates extensively with major biological databases to ensure comprehensive and up-to-date data analysis. The results of the enrichment analysis show a CSV file and several types of plots such as Bar Plots, BarPlot_qScore, Dot Plots, Lollipop Plots, Cnet Plots, Heatmap Plots, Upset Plots, Tree Plots, PubMed Trend Plots along with the KEGG Pathway Diagrams.
