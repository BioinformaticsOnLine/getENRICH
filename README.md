# getENRICH
getENRICH - Automated pipeline for enrichment analysis in non-model organisms!
getENRICH is designed to address the unique needs of researchers working with non-model organisms and model organisms. The tool features a user-friendly  interface (both GUI and CLI versions), ensuring that researchers can easily input data and interpret results. It boasts high accuracy and fast processing times, making it efficient for large datasets. Additionally, getENRICH is compatible with a wide range of non-model organisms and integrates extensively with major biological databases to ensure comprehensive and up-to-date data analysis. The development process involved collaboration with bioinformatics experts and utilised technologies such as Bash, R and R packages. The results of the enrichment analysis show a CSV file and several types of plots such as Bar Plots, BarPlot_qScore, Dot Plots, Lollipop Plots, Cnet Plots, Heatmap Plots, Upset Plots, Tree Plots, PubMed Trend Plots along with the KEGG Pathway Diagrams.
